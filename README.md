# Tab Limiter Extension

Tab Limiter is a Firefox extension that limits the number of tabs that can be open in a session, boosting your productivity.

## Motivation

How many times have you been browsing the web when you find a link you're curious about? Instead of going to another page to read it, you open a new tab and continue on the same page. As you keep scrolling, more interesting pages keep being linked and more new tabs keep being opened. Before you noticed, there are 10+ tabs opened and you don't know which ones to check first so you close most of them.

This extension aims to correct that. Whenever the user tries to open more than a certain number of tabs, they are prompted with a window to choose which tabs to keep open, helping the user decide which tabs are the truly interesting ones.

## Installation

Go to [url] and install the extension.

## Usage

You only need to have the extension activate for it to work. By default, the max number of open tabs allowed is 5 but you can change that number in the Options page of the plugin.
